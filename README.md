A program that will prompt you to make up to 3 AI players and define there charcteristics. A menu will give you options of what you would like to do next, the options being rolling a die, speaking to AI as a DM, letting an AI player speak, or endingthe  session.
The program uses an LLM called Llama 3.2 and gives it a special prompt so it can understand the rules and how to act for the game to be played.
